# Racing game
A simple racing game that I developed in my intro Java class. You need the player.java, racer.java, and racerDemo.java files to run it. It deals with some improper user input, but not all.

# Calendar
A simple calendar that I developed in my intro Java class. You just need the calendar.java file to run it. The only improper user input it deals with is trying to double-book. It also assumes that each month begins on Sunday and that it isn't a leap year.
